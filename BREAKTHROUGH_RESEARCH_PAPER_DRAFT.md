    def solve(self, problem):
        # Highly optimized 5-point stencil
        A = create_laplacian_matrix_2d(grid_size)
        solution = sparse_solve(A, rhs)
        return solution
```

        # Conjugate gradient with preconditioning
        solution = cg(A, rhs, preconditioner='jacobi')
        return solution
```

#### 3.2.2 Breakthrough Algorithms

**Neural-Analog Fusion Architecture**

Our breakthrough algorithm combines neural computation with analog crossbar operations:

```python
class NeuralAnalogPDESolver:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.neural_operator = NeuralPDEOperator(config)
        self.analog_crossbar = AnalogCrossbarLayer(config)
        self.fusion_gate = FusionGate(config)
    
    def forward(self, solution, source):
        # Neural contribution
        neural_output = self.neural_operator(solution, features)
        
        # Analog crossbar contribution  
        analog_output = self.analog_crossbar(solution.flatten())
        
        # Adaptive fusion
        fused_output = self.fusion_gate(
            neural_output, analog_output, solution
        )
        
        return fused_output + source
```

**Mathematical Foundation:**

The neural-analog fusion solves the PDE evolution equation:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = f_{neural}(u, \nabla u) + L_{analog}[u] + \sigma_{crossbar}(u) \cdot \xi(t)$$

Where:
- $f_{neural}$: Learned nonlinear neural dynamics

- $\sigma_{crossbar}$: State-dependent crossbar noise (exploited for regularization)
- $\xi(t)$: Analog device noise processes

For uncertainty quantification problems, we implement stochastic PDE solving:

```python
class StochasticPDESolver:
    def solve_monte_carlo(self, problem):
        # Exploit analog noise for Monte Carlo sampling
        samples = []
        for realization in range(num_samples):
            noise = self.analog_crossbar.get_noise_realization()
            sample_solution = self.solve_with_noise(problem, noise)
            samples.append(sample_solution)
        
        return compute_statistics(samples)
```
