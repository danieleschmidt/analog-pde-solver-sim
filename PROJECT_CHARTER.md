## Executive Summary

The Analog PDE Solver Simulation project aims to develop a comprehensive software framework for simulating and generating hardware designs for analog in-memory computing accelerators that solve partial differential equations. This project addresses the critical need for energy-efficient computational methods in scientific computing, targeting 100-1000× improvements in energy efficiency compared to traditional digital approaches.

## Problem Statement

Current digital PDE solvers consume significant computational resources and energy, particularly for large-scale scientific simulations in:
- Climate modeling and weather prediction
