# Contributing to Analog PDE Solver Simulation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the analog-pde-solver-sim project! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/analog-pde-solver-sim.git
   cd analog-pde-solver-sim
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Code Standards

- **Code Style:** Use `black` for formatting and `flake8` for linting
- **Type Hints:** Add type annotations to all functions
- **Documentation:** Include docstrings for all public functions
- **Testing:** Write tests for new features using `pytest`

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=analog_pde_solver  # With coverage
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes with appropriate tests
3. Ensure all tests pass and code is properly formatted
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Areas for Contribution

- **Additional PDE types** (Maxwell equations, Schr√∂dinger, etc.)
- **Improved noise models** for realistic analog behavior
- **Hardware validation** with actual memristor devices
- **Optimization algorithms** for crossbar programming
- **Documentation** and tutorials
