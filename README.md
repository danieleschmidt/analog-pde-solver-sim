# analog-pde-solver-sim
analog-pde-solver-sim explores the frontier of analog computing for partial differential equation solving. Inspired by Nature Photonics' coverage of sub-milliwatt in-pixel compute and EN100 IMC chip architectures, this toolkit enables prototyping of analog PDE solvers that achieve 100-1000Ã— energy efficiency over digital methods.
