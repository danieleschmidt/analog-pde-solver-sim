## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days for critical issues

## Security Considerations

### Hardware Simulation
- SPICE netlists may contain sensitive circuit information
- Verilog RTL generation could expose proprietary algorithms
- Never commit real hardware parameters or proprietary models

### Data Protection
- PDE solutions may contain sensitive scientific data  
- Analog noise patterns could be fingerprinted
- Use appropriate data sanitization in examples

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency scanning with `pip-audit`
- Monitor for vulnerabilities in PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy
- SPICE simulator security updates

### Development Environment
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Avoid running untrusted SPICE netlists or Verilog code
- Validate all external hardware models before use

## Secure Development Practices

1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all PDE parameters and boundary conditions
2. **Output Sanitization**: Remove sensitive data from logs and outputs  
3. **Access Control**: Limit filesystem access for generated files
4. **Cryptographic Libraries**: Use well-vetted libraries for any crypto operations
5. **Configuration Management**: Externalize secrets and API keys

## Known Security Considerations

- **SPICE Simulation**: Arbitrary netlist execution could be used maliciously
- **RTL Generation**: Generated Verilog code should be reviewed before synthesis
- **File I/O**: Restrict write access to prevent unauthorized file modification

## Security Updates

Security patches will be released as soon as possible after confirmation. Users are encouraged to:

- Subscribe to repository security advisories
- Update to the latest version promptly
- Review changelog for security-related changes

## Bug Bounty

We do not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge contributors in our security advisories.
