# Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, certain components require manual setup by repository maintainers.

## 🚨 Critical: GitHub Workflows Setup

**Status**: ❌ REQUIRED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

### What needs to be done:

1. **Copy workflow files to active location**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp docs/github-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

2. **Configure repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Get from [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) after connecting your repo
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For automated package releases (optional)
   - `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For testing releases (optional)

3. **Enable repository settings**:
   - Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions and reusable workflows
   - Settings → Actions → General → Read and write permissions
   - Settings → Security → Enable Dependabot alerts
   - Settings → Security → Enable secret scanning

4. **Set up branch protection** (Settings → Branches):
   - Protect `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
   - Require status checks to pass before merging

### Available workflows:
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci.yml`) - Testing, linting, coverage
- ✅ **Security Scanning** (`security.yml`) - Vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring** (`performance.yml`) - Benchmark tracking
- ✅ **Dependency Review** (`dependency-review.yml`) - License and vulnerability checking
- ✅ **CodeQL Analysis** (`codeql.yml`) - Advanced security analysis
- ✅ **Autonomous Value Discovery** (`autonomous-value-discovery.yml`) - AI-powered improvements

### Detailed setup guide:
📖 See `docs/workflows/GITHUB_WORKFLOWS_SETUP.md`

## 📊 Optional: Enhanced Monitoring Setup

**Status**: ⚠️ OPTIONAL  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### Monitoring Stack Components:

1. **Prometheus + Grafana** (for production deployments):
   ```bash
   # Deploy monitoring stack
   docker-compose -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
   
   # Access dashboards
   # Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (username: admin, password: admin)
   # Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   ```

2. **Health Check Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Test health checks
   python monitoring/health-checks/health_check.py
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

3. **Alert Configuration**:
   - Configure Slack/email notifications in `monitoring/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`
   - Customize alert thresholds in `monitoring/prometheus/rules/analog_pde_solver.yml`

### Benefits:
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automated alerting for issues
- Historical metrics and trends
- Production readiness monitoring

### Setup guide:
📖 See `docs/monitoring/README.md`

## 🔧 Optional: Development Environment Enhancements

**Status**: ⚠️ OPTIONAL  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

### Development Tools Setup:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Development containers**:
   ```bash
   # VS Code with Dev Containers extension
   # Open in container using .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   
   # Or manually with Docker
   docker-compose up -d dev
   docker-compose exec dev bash
   ```

3. **IDE Configuration**:
   - VS Code settings are pre-configured in `.vscode/settings.json`
   - Extensions recommendations in `.vscode/extensions.json`

### Benefits:
- Consistent code formatting
- Automated quality checks
- Standardized development environment
- Enhanced IDE experience

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

1. **Workflows not triggering**:
   - Check files are in `.github/workflows/` (not `docs/github-workflows/`)
   - Verify YAML syntax: `yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml`
   - Check repository Actions permissions

2. **Tests failing**:
   - Install system dependencies: `sudo apt-get install ngspice iverilog verilator`
   - Check Python version compatibility (3.9, 3.10, 3.11 supported)
   - Review test logs in GitHub Actions

3. **Security scanning issues**:
   - Update vulnerable dependencies: `pip-audit --fix`
   - Review and fix bandit security warnings
   - Check secrets configuration

### Support Resources:
- 📖 **Documentation**: `docs/` directory contains comprehensive guides
- 🐛 **Issues**: Create GitHub issues for problems
- 💬 **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- 📧 **Contact**: Reach out to the development team
