# GitHub Actions Workflows Setup Guide

This repository contains comprehensive workflow templates in `docs/github-workflows/` that need to be manually copied to `.github/workflows/` to become active.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Manual Setup Required

Due to security restrictions, the GitHub Actions workflows cannot be automatically created. You must manually copy the workflow files from the templates directory.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Create the workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy all workflow templates
cp docs/github-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Verify the copy
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

## Required Secrets and Configuration

After copying the workflows, configure these repository secrets:

### GitHub Repository Secrets
```bash
# In GitHub repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions

CODECOV_TOKEN          # For test coverage reporting
```

### Repository Variables
```bash
# In GitHub repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ Variables

PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD  # Performance regression threshold (default: 5)
SECURITY_THRESHOLD     # Security scanning threshold (default: medium)
```

## Environment Setup

The workflows require these system dependencies to be available:

### Ubuntu/Debian Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    ngspice \
    iverilog \
    verilator \
    build-essential \
    cmake
```

### Python Dependencies
All Python dependencies are automatically installed via:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,hardware]"
```

## Workflow Permissions

Ensure your repository has the following permissions enabled:

### Repository Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
- **Actions permissions**: Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- **Workflow permissions**: Read and write permissions
- **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**: âœ… Enabled

### Security Settings
- **Dependabot alerts**: âœ… Enabled
- **Dependency graph**: âœ… Enabled
- **Dependabot security updates**: âœ… Enabled

## Validation Checklist

After setting up the workflows, verify:

- [ ] All workflow files copied to `.github/workflows/`
- [ ] Repository secrets configured
- [ ] Actions permissions enabled
- [ ] First workflow run successful
- [ ] Security scanning enabled
- [ ] Performance benchmarking working
- [ ] Autonomous value discovery active

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Workflow Modifications

You can customize the workflows by editing:

```yaml
# Modify Python versions
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

# Adjust performance thresholds
env:
  PERFORMANCE_REGRESSION_THRESHOLD: 10  # 10% regression allowed

# Configure security scanning
bandit:
  severity: high
  confidence: high
```

### Integration with External Services

The workflows support integration with:

- **Codecov**: Test coverage reporting
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Advanced security analysis
- **GitHub Security**: Vulnerability management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**:
   - Check file location: `.github/workflows/` (not `docs/github-workflows/`)
   - Verify YAML syntax with `yamllint`
   - Check repository permissions

2. **Dependency installation failures**:
   - Verify system dependencies in workflow
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Review requirements.txt for conflicts

3. **Security scanning failures**:
   - Update security tools to latest versions
   - Review and fix identified vulnerabilities
   - Adjust security thresholds if needed

4. **Performance benchmark failures**:
   - Increase timeout limits for large problems
   - Verify system resources availability
   - Check memory limits

### Getting Help

- Review workflow logs in Actions tab
- Check repository Issues for known problems
- Consult the troubleshooting guide: `docs/troubleshooting.md`

## Continuous Improvement

The autonomous value discovery system will:

1. **Monitor workflow performance** and suggest optimizations
2. **Identify bottlenecks** in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Recommend new tools** and integrations
4. **Track metrics** and provide improvement suggestions

This creates a self-improving SDLC that continuously enhances developer productivity and code quality.

## Next Steps

1. **Copy workflows** from templates to active directory
2. **Configure secrets** and permissions
3. **Test first workflow run** by creating a small commit
4. **Monitor dashboard** for autonomous value discovery results
5. **Review and approve** any automated improvement PRs

The autonomous SDLC system will take over from here, continuously discovering and implementing the highest-value improvements to your development workflow.
