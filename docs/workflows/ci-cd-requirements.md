# CI/CD Requirements for Analog PDE Solver

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended CI/CD workflows for the analog-pde-solver-sim project. Since this repository focuses on scientific computing with hardware simulation, special considerations are needed for testing and deployment.

## Required GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Daily schedule for dependency checks

**Jobs**:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    
    steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Setup Python and dependencies
      - Install system dependencies (NgSpice, Verilog tools)
      - Run pytest with coverage
      - Upload coverage to Codecov
```

**System Dependencies**:
- NgSpice circuit simulator
- Icarus Verilog or Verilator
- BLAS/LAPACK libraries

### 2. Code Quality Checks

**File**: `.github/workflows/quality.yml`

**Checks**:
- Black code formatting
- Flake8 linting
- mypy type checking
- isort import sorting
- Security scanning with bandit

### 3. Documentation Build

**File**: `.github/workflows/docs.yml`

**Features**:
- Build Sphinx documentation
- Deploy to GitHub Pages on main branch
- Check for broken links
- Generate API documentation from docstrings

### 4. Dependency Security Scanning

**File**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`

**Scans**:
- Known vulnerabilities in Python packages
- License compatibility checks
- Supply chain security (SLSA)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Core PDE solver algorithms
- Hardware model accuracy
- Mathematical correctness

### Integration Tests
- SPICE simulation integration
- Verilog generation and compilation
- End-to-end solver workflows

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark against reference solutions
- Memory usage validation
- Convergence rate verification

### Hardware-in-the-Loop (Optional)
- Real memristor device validation
- FPGA implementation testing
- Power consumption measurement

## Deployment Considerations

### PyPI Publishing
```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    - Build source and wheel distributions
    - Upload to PyPI using trusted publishing
    - Create GitHub release assets
```

### Container Images
- Docker images for reproducible simulations
- Include pre-installed SPICE and Verilog tools
- Multi-architecture support (x86_64, ARM64)

### Documentation Deployment
- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- Version-specific documentation
- API reference generation

## Environment Variables and Secrets

### Required Secrets
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For package publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting

### Environment Variables
- `SPICE_SIMULATOR_PATH`: Path to NgSpice executable
- `VERILOG_SIMULATOR`: Preferred Verilog simulator

## Artifact Management

### Build Artifacts
- Wheel and source distributions
- Documentation builds
- Test coverage reports
- Performance benchmark results

### Simulation Artifacts
- Large SPICE simulation outputs (use git-lfs)
- Generated Verilog files
- Hardware synthesis reports

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Performance Regression Detection
- Benchmark comparison against previous versions
- Memory usage trend analysis
- Convergence rate monitoring

### Dependency Updates
- Automated PR creation for security updates
- Weekly dependency freshness checks
- Breaking change detection

## Special Considerations

### Scientific Computing
- Numerical accuracy verification
- Cross-platform floating-point consistency
- Large matrix operation testing

### Hardware Simulation
- Long-running SPICE simulations
- Timeout handling for complex circuits
- Resource-intensive Verilog compilation

### Documentation
- Mathematical equation rendering
- Interactive Jupyter notebook examples
- Hardware schematic inclusion

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Basic CI with Python testing
2. **Phase 2**: Add SPICE/Verilog integration tests
3. **Phase 3**: Performance benchmarking and monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced security and compliance scanning

This CI/CD strategy ensures robust testing while accommodating the unique requirements of analog computing simulation research.
